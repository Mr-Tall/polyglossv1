\l d has never seen hunger; throughout the country there is plenty of food. The people of the South grow rice and sweet potatoes, and in the North people grow millet and wheat. And in Africa, Chad is one of the countries which has a lot of meat; it has cattle and camels. Chad exports meat and leather to its neighbors. Wild game is also plentiful. In the wilderness of Chad from South to North you find all kinds of animals from lion, deer, elephant, camel and buffalo to rabbit. Chad has been a republic since the twenty eighth of the eleventh month [November] of the year one thousand nine hundred and fifty eight. And Chad gained its independence on the eleventh day of the eighth month [August] of the year one thousand nine hundred and sixty. All of the Chadians elect their deputies, and there are fifty eight of them, for five years. And the Chadians also elect the president of the republic for seven years. The flag of Chad has three colors: blue and red and yellow. In the North of the country everyone is Muslim and in the South of the country many are Christian. It is hot during the day and at night during summer, but in winter it is cold in the morning and at night. The principal agricultural products in Chad are cotton and peanuts, but people also grow millet, rice, beans and wheat. And in Chad there are salt, sugar, natron and peanut oil industries.
