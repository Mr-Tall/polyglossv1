\l How To Cook Snails First we cut off their tails. After that we wash them. And we put the water on, depending on how we want to cook them. If they are cooked just in water, tomatoes and onions are thrown in with them. When the water is boiling, they are put in the water, and they boil once. And if we want to stew them in cornmeal dough, then first we make the dough, and then we grind in tomatoes. And then in goes the achiote, and then we put it on top of the fire, and we begin to stir so that it does not get a burned taste. When the cornmeal is already boiling, then the snails go in, and epazote is thrown in with them. We taste to see how they are. When they are ready, we take them off the fire. That is how snails are prepared.
