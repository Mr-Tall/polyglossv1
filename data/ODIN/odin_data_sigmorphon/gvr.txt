\l Free Translation; The Old Man and the Old Woman 1. Once upon a time, in Nepal, there lived an old man and an old woman in such and such a village, 2. They didnft have any children. 3. The old man and the old woman were extremely poor. 4. They did not have any fields. 5. They did not have any brothers, 6. Only by going around the village begging could they have food to eat. 7. One day they brought some small rice grain chips which they had begged for round the village, 8, Then the old woman began to grind the rice. 9. The old man went round the village begging for butter, 10. In just a little while the old woman had finished grinding the rice. 11. At the moment she finished grinding the rice the old man arrived at their house. 12. He said, "Listen old woman, I, from the village have sought and brought the butter. You therefore must bake some bread. Then we can share the bread and eat it." 13. So the old woman blew the fire into life and put the bread-baking pan on the tripod. 14. Then the old woman set about to bake the bread. 15. The old man rested on the bed. 16. In a little while the old woman had finished baking the bread. 17. Then the old woman said "OhI old man; get up. The bread is finished baking, so now eat it!"        18, In all there were only five rolls. 19, The old woman divided three for herself and two for the old man, but then the old man said, "This shouldn't be. I brought the butter after searching for it. You only baked the bread. How many men did I have to greet begging for that butter. You (only) baked the bread. 20. You eat two, I will eat three." 21. The old woman replied, H0h no! I sought for the rice chippings; I ground the rice; I blew the fire into life; I baked the bread; I had all the difficult work to do, therefore three I will eat, two you can eat. 22. In this way they continued arguing, but nothing was solved. But then the old man had a thought - tomorrow morning the old woman shall rise first. Thus thinking he became cunning and said, M¥e shouldn't stay this way. Let us sleep, and the one who rises later can eat three." 24. M0K,W said the old woman, and so they both went to sleep. 25. The next morning the old man said to himself, "If the old wom^tn rises first, three I will eat, two the old woman will eat." The old woman was saying to herself, "if the old man riaes first, he will have two and I'll have three." So saying they stayed (neither getting up) . With such hunger in them, they died. 26. In three days the people of the village came. 27· "it's now three days since the old man and the old woman have come outside; what's happened?" So asking, they looked in. 28. And so they found the old man dead and the old woman dead, and five rolls in the pan. 29 · The people of the village took the old man and the old woman to the cremation place. 30. At the cremation place, having laid some wood and kindling on a stone platform, they set about to burn them. The old man they placed below and the old woman on top. Then they set the pyre alight. 31. In forme; times, when a dead body caught alight, it said, "OuchJ" and sat up. 32. (Thus) the old woman (did). Then the old man caught alight, and he too said, "Ouch, and sat up. 33. In the early days there were people cremated who came back to life. 34. Then the people of the village asked, "What happened to you?" They said, "It happened like this. We, an old man and an old woman, begged rice fragments and butter around the village. The old woman made bread--it was only five rolls--and said, 'I will eat three, you eat two.1 The old maa said, 'You eat two; I will eat three.' We went on and on, arguing and sitting, and we didn't know what was happening.
