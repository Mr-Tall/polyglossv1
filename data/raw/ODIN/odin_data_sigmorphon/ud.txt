\l Nearby the ravine, there (once) lived some Maris (lit. two-three houses full of Maris). They separated from the Udmurts, because they did not get along and left to this ravine. Seemingly, they did not found a village there. I don't know whether they died or whether they left. Their houses were left and that's why this place is called vuzkorkauk (the ravine of old houses).
